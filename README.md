# Netflix Data Analysis with Python
Data analysis using python

Netflix is one of the largest providers of online streaming entertainment services. It collects a huge amount of data because it has a very large subscriber base all over the world. 

Netflix Data Analysis:

We can analyze a lot of data and models from Netflix because this platform has consistently focused on changing business needs by shifting its business model from on-demand DVD movie rental and now focusing a lot about the production of their original shows.

Some of the most important tasks that we can analyze from Netflix data are:
1.	understand what content is available
2.	Cleaning the data for analysis
3.	understand the ratings for the content
4.	understand the top successful actors and directors
5.	The content distribution analysis
6.	and sentiment analysis of content available on Netflix.

Netflix Data Analysis with Python

The dataset I use for the Netflix data analytics task consists of TV shows and movies streamed on Netflix as of 2019. 

1.Distribution of Content:

To begin the task of analyzing Netflix data, I’ll start by looking at the distribution of content ratings on Netflix:

The graph above shows that the majority of content on Netflix is categorized as “TV-MA”, which means that most of the content available on Netflix is intended for viewing by mature and adult audiences

2. Top successful Directors

3. Top successful Actors

4. Content Produced Over the year

The above line graph shows that there has been a decline in the production of the content for both movies and other shows since 2018.

5. Sentiment Analysis

At last, to conclude our analysis, I will analyze the sentiment of content on Netflix:

So the above graph shows that the overall positive content is always greater than the neutral and negative content combined.
